# weather app

## Summary
  
in this project I made a basic weather application where I applied the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeather</a> api thus making a simple but functional code with html css and javascript. 
### what i learned?
in this javascript project I had to apply a lot of api usage and a practical use to create a clean and readable code.
